Currently, Revit does not provide any built-in functionality to prevent the user from modifying parameter values.
RvtLock3r is a Revit add-in that you can use to verify whether parameter values have been changed. 

There are two types of end users for RvtLock3r: 

- Vendor: the provider of a set of elements with protected properties 
- Consumer: the consumer of these elements to create a model 

## Vendor 

The vendor defines the BIM elements properties they want to protect, also known as _ground truth_.

They make use of two external commands in the Revit ribbon tab _Lock3r_ in the panel _Validation_:  

- Ground Truth: this command generates the ground truth data and saves it in the Revit BIM. 
- Validate: this command checks if any protected properties have been modified.

The application will run successfully without any error if the model is original or is not modified. In case any of the protected properties were modified, the application throws an error with a message and a list of element ids of the modified elements. (See the image below)

The vendor can manually validate a given model to check if any prohibited property has been modified using the 


Consumer 

The consumer will use the elements that have read-only properties that the vendor has provided. The consumer can interact with modelthe model however they wish. The interaction is based on trust that they will not interfere with prohibited properties. The consumer may see warning dialogs from RvtLock3r in the following two scenarios:  

The consumer opens a model containing modified properties 

The consumer tried to save a model containing modified properties 

Case 1.  In case the consumer opens a model containing modified properties from whichever source, an informational dialog box is provided to inform the user that the protected properties have been tampered with. They may choose to proceed with the tampered model or contact the vendor for the original data.

Case 2.  During interaction with the model, the consumer may intentionally or unintentionally modify a protected property. When they try to save, an informational dialog box is provided informing the user that the property is read-onlyread-only, and they are not allowed to modify it.

In case the consumer decides to close Revit with open unsaved modifications, an optional dialog box is provided for the consumerâ€™s decision to save or not save the model.

If the consumer chooses `Yes`, the model is saved; if `No`, it remains unchanged.
